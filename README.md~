Workshop 4

- I think the swap and check functions need to be in a javascript file under public/javascript. He
mentions these function should be in a library. I just put them in index.js to get them coded up.
 
"You should include a `swap` function for swapping two
values in the puzzle and a `check` function to determine if the puzzle
has been solved. You can test your functions with test data in the
library that you create."
